# System.Functional

Why do we need yet another package in our working environment?
This package (`System.Functional`) contains a minimum extensions and classes to write more readable functional code in C#.

Most developers will know the LINQ library; which does the same thing some extensions in this package does.

Off course, thinking in another way takes a lot more time then downloading this package; but it's a start.
